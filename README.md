This repository invokes nostalgic memories about my high school times, when I was passionately in love with C++.
It was then when I realized (not invented, of course) that virtual functions and templates combined can provide a way to dynamically extend the same string interpreter with new commands bound to functions of different types.
Of course, the educated folks can easily recognize the *type erasure* pattern here, but back then it felt like an incredibly harmonic combination of powerfull mject-oriented systemetaprogramming abilities which are specific to C++ and dynamic abstraction which is widely used in object-oriented systems.

While the idea turned out to be not too novel to be used on its own, it can absolutely be used as a demonstration of expressional power of C++ in the form of exercises.
Feel free to use it however you like.
For understanding the interface, see tests located [here](./tests/src/interpreter_test_1.cpp).
